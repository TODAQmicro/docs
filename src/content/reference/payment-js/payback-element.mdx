## Payback Element

The Payback Element allows you to provide a way to pay your users back. This is
useful in situations where you would like to reward your users for certain
actions.

Which is simply implemented using the Elements SDK `create()` function.

```javascript
await elements.create("payback", { hash: "<HASH>" });
```
<br />

#### Full Implemention

```javascript
/// We get an `HTMLElement` that we would like to use for the Payback Element. 
const el = document.getElementById("ref");

/// Load the JS SDK.
const micro = await loadMicroPayments("<PUBLIC_SECRET>", { apiVersion: "main" });

/// We're going to be using Elements. 
const elements = micro.elements();

if (elements) {
  /// We'll create an Element with the `type` argument set to `payback`. You
  /// will also need to create a Commodity and provide the Commodity's `hash`.
  const embed = await elements.create("payback", { hash: "<HASH>" });

  /// As long as everything worked out correctly, and there were no issues,
  /// mount the Element to our `HTMLElement`.
  if (embed && el) {
    embed.mount(el);
  }
};
```

Where `<PUBLIC_SECRET>` is replaced with your User or Account Public Secret. and
`<HASH>` is replaced with a Commodity hash identifier. You can create a
Commodity using either the [Node.JS SDK]() or the [Create Commodity API]()
request.

### Payback Element with Consent

There may be situations that you would like to gain access to a user's personal
information. This can be accomplished by providing the Payback Element with some
Consent configured.

<br />
<br />
<Element
  type="payback"
  hash="6ace4c52-a9b5-4e7a-9d98-589151a7a058"
  consent={{
    'acme_email_consent': {
      type: 0,
      metadata: [
        {
          name: 'email',
          label: 'Email associated with your wallet',
          description:
            'Longer form text that should include a description of what the email will be used for.',
        },
      ],
    },
    'acme_terms': {
      type: 3,
      metadata: [
        {
          name: 'terms',
          label: 'By signing checking this box, you agree to the [Terms of Service](#) and [Privacy Policy](#), includingg Cookie Use.',
          checked: false,
          required: true,
        }
      ],
    },
  }}
  client:load />
<br />
<br />

### Destroying the Payback Element

At any time, you may want to remove the Payback Element. 

<br />
<br />
<Element
  type="payback"
  hash="06880c0d-7394-40a0-b58d-d9adc3d840a9"
  destroy={true}
  client:load />
<br />
<br />

```javascript
const embed = await elements.create("payback", { hash: "<HASH>" });

embed.destroy();
```
<br /><br />

### Dark mode

<br />
<br />
<Element
  type="payback"
  theme="dark"
  hash="06880c0d-7394-40a0-b58d-d9adc3d840a9"
  client:load />
<br />
<br />
