## What Are Personas?

**Personas** in the TODAQ Micro payment system serve as a **digital identity and access control mechanism**. They are:

- **Digital identity tokens** that can be delegated to users after they make a purchase
- **Access credentials** that prove a user has paid for specific content or services  
- **Verification tokens** with different levels/tiers (like "fan #1", "fan #2", etc.)

## How Personas Work

1. **Purchase Flow**: User pays for content → system validates payment → **persona is delegated** to user's "twin" (their digital wallet)
2. **Access Control**: User can later **verify** they have a specific persona to access premium content
3. **Tiered Access**: Different personas provide different access levels

## Use Cases

- **Subscription/Membership** verification (prove you're a paying subscriber)
- **Content Unlocking** (access premium articles, downloads, features after payment)
- **Tiered Access** (different persona levels = different privileges)
- **Persistent Identity** across sessions (once delegated, persona stays with user)

## The Complete Flow

```
Payment → Validation → Persona Delegation → Future Access Verification
```

Essentially, personas solve the problem of **"How do I prove this user paid for access to X?"** - they're cryptographic proof of purchase that enables persistent access to paid content without requiring users to pay again for the same content.
