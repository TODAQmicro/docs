## Transparent payment button

In this guide we will take advantage of the Payment Element's theme and styling options to create a transparent button overtop of some other existing element on a page. This enables the implementer to make almost anything micropayable.

[TOC]

### 1. Integrating Micropayments Library into Your Project

Choose an import mechanism that suits your project requirements and integrate it into your website or application.

You can use either from a CDN:

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.stage.m.todaq.net/micropay.js"></script>
```

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: `type="module"` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` are required attributes.
</p>

Or through `npm` and have the bundler of your choice include it in the build files.

```bash
npm install --save @todaqmicro/payment-js
```

### 2. Setup Payment client

Next we need to generate a payment element. In this example we assume you have already created a commodity with the [Payment Node.JS SDK](#).

```javascript
const micro = await loadMicroPayments(
  // Replace <PUBLIC_SECRET> with your accounts' public secret.
  "<PUBLIC_SECRET>",
  { apiVersion: 'main' }
);

const elements = micro.elements();
```

### 3. Generate transparent Payment Element

```javascript
const element = await elements.create('payment', {
  // Replace <HASH> with the commodities hash.
  hash: '<HASH>',
  theme: "light",
  styles: {
    colorPrimary: 'transparent',
    colorBackground: 'transparent',
  },
});
```

#### Theme and Style options

### 4. Mounting Payment Element on Your Webpage

Designate a suitable location on your webpage to mount the payment element. Consider user experience and accessibility when placing the payment interface to maximize conversion rates.

```javascript
if (element) {
  element.mount("#signup-submit");
}
```
