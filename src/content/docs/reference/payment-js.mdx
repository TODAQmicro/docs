## Payment Client JS SDK

Client side JavaScript/TypeScript library for accepting Micropayments

#### Installation

You can use either from a CDN:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.stage.m.todaq.net/micropay.min.js"></script>
```

Or through `npm`

```bash
npm install --save @todaqmicro/payment-js
```

#### Basic Usage

The most basic way to set up a micro payment button is using `elements`.

```javascript
const micro = await loadMicroPayments(
  // Replace <PUBLIC_SECRET> with your accounts' public secret.
  "<PUBLIC_SECRET>",
  { apiVersion: 'main' }
);

const elements = micro.elements();
const button = await elements.create('payment', {
  // Replace <HASH> with the commodities hash.
  hash: '<HASH>',
  theme: "light",
  styles: {
    colorPrimary: '#000000',
    colorBackground: '#FDB902',
    borderRadius: '0',
  },
});

if (button) {
  button.mount("#signup-submit");        
}
```

There are three major steps in creating a micro payment button:

1. Load the MicroPayment SDK with `loadMicroPayments` using `async/await` or `Promises`.
2. Create a `payment` element using the `elements.create()` function.
3. Mount the `payment1` element to a DOM element with `.mount()`.

When a payment has been made a `payment` event is emitted on the HTML `document` DOM element. Simply add an event listener and then you can validate the payment with the `validatePayment` function on the server side.
