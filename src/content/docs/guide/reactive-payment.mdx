## Reactive Payments

In this example we are using a `<video>` element and the Media Source API to track a video's progress. After the video has played for a short period of time, pause, disable controls and ask the viewer to pay to continue.

[TOC]

#### Assumptions

We assume you have already gone through the [Getting Started guide](/guide/getting-started). As a result, we also assume you already have obtained your account details including your **public secret**, **client secret** and **client secret ID**.

We assume you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, and the [Media Source API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API).

### 1. Integrating Micropayments Library into Your Project

Choose an import mechanism that suits your project requirements and integrate it into your website or application.

You can use either from a CDN:

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.stage.m.todaq.net/micropay.js"></script>
```

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: `type="module"` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` are required attributes.
</p>

Or through `npm` and have the bundler of your choice include it in the build files.

```bash
npm install --save @todaqmicro/payment-js
```

### 2. Setup your audio or video source

Your audio or video source will come in the form of an `<audio>` or `<video>` tag. If you are using a library to display your media, you will need to figure out how it hooks into either of the two HTML tags. **Without access to the media elements, such as with an embed snippet, you will not be able to capture the correct events to initiate the payment flow.**


```javascript
const video = document.querySelector('video');

video.addEventListener('play', () => {
  // ...
});

video.addEventListener('pause', () => {
  // ...
});
```


### 3. Generate Payment Element

Next we need to generate a payment element. In this example we assume you have already created a commodity with the [Payment Node.JS SDK](/reference/payment-node/).

```javascript
const micro = await loadMicroPayments(
  // Replace <PUBLIC_SECRET> with your accounts' public secret.
  "<PUBLIC_SECRET>",
  { apiVersion: 'main' }
);

const elements = micro.elements();
const element = await elements.create('payment', {
  // Replace <HASH> with the commodities hash.
  hash: '<HASH>',
  theme: "light",
  styles: {
    colorPrimary: '#000000',
    colorBackground: '#FDB902',
    borderRadius: '0',
  },
});
```

Replace `<PUBLIC_SECRET>` with your accountâ€™s public secret, and `<HASH>` with the hash ID. Checkout the [Getting Started guide](/guide/getting-started) for details on how to retrieve your account secrets.


### 4. Based on an event, toggle payment flow

```javascript
const timeout = setInterval(() => {
  if (video.currentTime >= 15) { // If the video is at 15 seconds or greater

    video.controls = false;
    video.pause();

    element.toggle();

    clearInterval(timeout);

  }
}, 100); // 100 microseconds
```

### 5. Payment completed, resume

```javascript
document.addEventListener('purchase', () => {
  video.play();
  video.controls = true;
});
```
